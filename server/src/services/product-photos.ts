// Product Photo Studio: 1–3 phone photos of a product in, about 8 professional shots out, each sized for
// where the owner will use it. The owner's fear is that AI changes their product, so it is pinned at every
// step. Analyst (vision model) writes a fingerprint of each photo: what it is, every word on the label
// exactly as printed, colours, shape, material, camera angle; blurry, cut-off or crowded photos are set
// aside with a plain reason → the shot list comes from fixed recipes in code, chosen by where the photos
// will be used (marketplace, Instagram, WhatsApp, website) and the look (clean, lifestyle, bold); a fast
// model only picks the surface, backdrop, settings and props, as short strings that code checks →
// Illustrator remakes the owner's photo for each shot (Nano Banana Pro edit), every prompt opening with the
// fingerprint → code finishes each shot to its exact size (marketplace: background keyed to pure white,
// product re-centred) → Auditor (vision model, a different maker from the image model) looks at original and
// result side by side with fixed yes/no questions, and code decides pass or fail; a failed shot is remade
// once with a stricter prompt, then left out. At most 10 image calls per job. Code makes the before/after
// sheet, copies for social with the owner's own logo file (never drawn by AI), and a zip.
